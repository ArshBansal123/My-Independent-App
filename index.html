                    <h3 class= "3">Archimedes, (born c. 287 BCE, Syracuse, Sicily [Italy]—died 212/211 BCE, Syracuse), the most famous mathematician and inventor in ancient Greece. Archimedes 
                is especially important for his discovery of the relation between the surface and volume of a sphere and its circumscribing cylinder. He is known for his formulation of a hydrostatic principle (known as Archimedes’ principle) 
                and a device for raising water, still used, known as the Archimedes screw.</h3>
           
   
                    <h2 class= "2">What is Archimedes' Principle</h2>
                    <h3 id= "3">A body at rest in a fluid is acted upon by a force pushing upward called the 
                        buoyant force, which is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. If the body is 
                        completely submerged, the volume of fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the body. If the body is only
                         partially submerged, the volume of the fluid displaced is 
                        equal to the volume of the part of the body that is submerged.</h3>
